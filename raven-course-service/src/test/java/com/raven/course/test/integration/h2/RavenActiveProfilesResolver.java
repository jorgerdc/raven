/**
 * This class is used to decide which profile will be activated for testing. The rules and
 * the number of profiles are project specific. In this case there are 3 profiles that
 * where designed mainly to show how the spring handles this mechanism. These profiles can
 * be activated in the following order:<br>
 * <br>
 * 1. Check if an H2 server is running by creating a Socket. If the connection is
 * successful, the profile "h2-server" is activated.<br>
 * <br>
 * 2. If not H2 server is running, check if the database files exist under
 * src/test/resources/databases/h2/schemas. If the files exist, "h2-no-server" profile is
 * activated.<br>
 * <br>
 * 3.Finally if no database files are found, "h2-embedded" profile will be activated
 * which will be used to create a new database for every test run.
